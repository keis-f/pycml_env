The Python based open source software pycomlink is intended to provide an intelligible tool for processing commercial microwave link (CML) data for meteorological and hydrological purposes.
Its source code is published under the MIT license and is freely available [here](https://bitbucket.org/cchwala/pycomlink). The latest documentation of pycomlink is published [here](http://pycomlink.readthedocs.org).
pycomlink works with Python 2.7 and depends on numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, cartopy and numba. You can install it via pip, but it is recommended that you install the dependecies first. We recommend the usage of the Anaconda Python distribution for all scientific python packages.
